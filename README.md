## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** CSS, JavaScript, React, NodeJs, MongoDBIn this project, css, javascript and react were used for the front-end portion. Node, express, and MongoDB were used for the backend portion of this project to handle the server. 

## Optimizations

This project is currently still being developed, current optimizations include:

- adding user authentication allowing user to sign in 
- allowing user ability to upload a video with their post 
- adding an edit ability to workout post

## Lessons Learned:

The lessons learned in this project were invaluable. I was able to cement the fundamentals of using JSX syntax in react, incorporating React router to navigate through the app, and making a fetch request to connect the server to the frontend by implementing async function.
